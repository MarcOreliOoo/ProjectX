## List

###  Saving unencrypted confidential data on the blockchain 
We do not store any confidential information nor on chain, nor off chain.  
:white_check_mark: Done 

### Integer overflow and underflow
Solidity solveds this issue in 0.8.  
:white_check_mark: Done 

### Unchecked call return values  
In the withdraw function of CommownSW.sol
```
(bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: _amount}("");
require(success, "transaction failed"); //Require the transactoin success or revert
```
:white_check_mark: Done

### Re-entrancy attacks
In the same function "withdraw" of CommownSW.sol, we use the "non reentrancy pattern" by updating the balance before sending ethers to the caller.
```
balancePerUser[msg.sender] -= _amount; //Update the amount before the transaction is called to avoid reentrancy attack

(bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: _amount}("");
require(success, "transaction failed"); //Require the transactoin success or revert
```
:white_check_mark: Done

### Denial Of Service attacks

CF Constructor : Todo

### Front Running attacks
We don't have a menacism of rewards for being the first at something for example.  
:white_check_mark: Done

### Replay signatures attacks
At the time of the POC, we do not yet have the signature off chain module. So we will probably exposed to that attack and should take care of it. A common solution is adding a nonce per account to a signed message and asap the message is signed, it increments the nonce.  
See [eip-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712)

### Function default visibility
Function internals are for proxy upgrade, or technical function like the initialize are covered by modifier.  
:white_check_mark: Done

### Floating pragma
Pragma is fixed at 0.8.13.  
:white_check_mark: Done

### Loop through long arrays
:white_square_button: To check

### Wrong inheritance
Inheritance from most generic to most specific : Initializable, UUPSUpgradeable, OwnableUpgradeable, IERC721Receiver to avoid linearization problem.  
:white_check_mark: Done

### Unexpected ether balance
We would have to add an ether balance uint inside the contrat and compare it each time we do a withdraw to the real ether balance. If different, that means we have this unexpected ether balance. Althoug, our contract being upgradable we would be able to withdram from it.  
:white_check_mark: Done

### Access outside array limits
:white_square_button: To check

### Delegate calls to untrusted sources
:white_square_button: To check

### (Regular) calls to untrusted sources
:white_square_button: To check

### Insecure randomness
:white_square_button: To check

### Block Timestamp manipulation
:white_square_button: To check

### Contracts with zero code
:white_square_button: To check

### Uninitialized Storage Pointers
:white_square_button: To check

### Unupgradable smart contracts
